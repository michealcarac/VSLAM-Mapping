# VSLAM-Mapping
VSLAMing with cameras and creating maps 

We are creating a autonomous wheelchair that is assisted by the usage of VSLAM. 

Deployed on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier, an embedded computer, we are using VSLAM, algorithmic programming, and Deep Reinforcement Learning to autonomously drive a wheelchair around a building, avoiding all objects in the path. 

We will be using a single Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier for the best possible inference time from the Reinforcement Model.
